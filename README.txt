# Fingerprint classification

The aim of the project is to write a program to classify 
fingerprints into certain types:
left loop, right loop, whirl, arch, tented arch

The fingerprints are provided by The National Institute of Standards and Technology

Summary of each of the files and folders:

## trainingSet

A folder that contains 3985 images for training. 
Each image is in one of five directories corresponding to its correct classification.

Class:
A : arch
L : left loop
R : right loop
T : tented arch
W : whirl

## testSet

How will your algorithm fare against the random test set of 15 images
